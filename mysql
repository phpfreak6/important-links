MYSQL

This is as a result of some files in C:\xampp\mysql\data\mysql getting corrupted.

Solution:

Back up C:\xampp\mysql\data
Copy all file C:\xampp\mysql\backup
Paste and replace existing file in: C:\xampp\mysql\data, except for the ibdata1 file.
Leaving ibdata1 will help against table does not exist error.
