Artisan is the command-line interface included with Laravel. It provides a number of helpful commands that can assist you while you build your application. Here I am gonna show you a command which will generate controller, modal and migration files.

php artisan make:model Modelname -crm
php artisan make:model Modelname -crm
As you can see, actually the command is for creating modal but by passing -crm arguments we can generate controller and migration files.

Console output might be as shown below â€“

$ php artisan make:model Modelname -crm
Model created successfully.
Created Migration: 2017_06_03_150652_create_modelnames_table
Controller created successfully.
$ php artisan make:model Modelname -crm
Model created successfully.
Created Migration: 2017_06_03_150652_create_modelnames_table
Controller created successfully.

In my opinion how you are approaching it is fine:

response is the full response object via axios
response.data is the full response body that was returned
response.data.data is the data node of the response body that was returned
Some suggestions:

instead of using success in your response, that can be implied from the returned status code: anything within 200-299 is successful, anything 300-399 is a redirect, anything 400-499 is a client error, and anything 500+ is a server error (see here)
instead of using data in the instance of an error, in my opinion that node should be reserved for successful data and a node such as errors should be used instead
your sendError method should default to a status code of 500 instead of 200, as 200 is a successful status code
